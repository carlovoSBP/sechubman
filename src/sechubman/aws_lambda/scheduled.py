"""Standalone scheduled Lambda handler.

Loads the configured rules (from S3, or a local file bundled in the deployment package) and
applies all of them against every currently matching Security Hub finding. Intended to be run on
a schedule (e.g. via an EventBridge rule) rather than triggered by individual finding or rules
events; see `sechubman.aws_lambda.events`, `.trigger` and `.worker` for the event-driven pipeline
used by `terraform-aws-mcaf-securityhub-findings-manager`.

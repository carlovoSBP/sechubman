"""S3-triggered Lambda handler.

Fired when the rules document is uploaded to S3. Loads the rules and fans each one out as its
own message on SQS, carrying the shared `ManagerConfig` alongside it, so that the worker Lambda
(`sechubman.aws_lambda.worker`) can build an equivalent single-rule Manager for it.

Unlike `events.lambda_handler`, failures here are raised rather than swallowed: there is no
downstream Step Function branching on this handler's result, and a failure to queue rules should
be visible (e.g. via a Lambda error metric alarm) rather than silently skipped.

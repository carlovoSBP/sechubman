"""SQS-triggered Lambda handler.

Each SQS record carries a single-rule rules document (as produced by
`sechubman.aws_lambda.trigger`): applies that rule against all currently matching Security Hub
findings.

Failures are reported per record via SQS's partial batch response contract
(`{"batchItemFailures": [...]}`), not by raising: a failed record becomes visible again after the
queue's visibility timeout and is retried (and eventually sent to the dead-letter queue per the
queue's redrive policy) without the whole batch, including already-successful records, being
reprocessed. This requires `function_response_types = ["ReportBatchItemFailures"]` to be set on
the event source mapping; without it, Lambda ignores this return value and deletes the entire
batch regardless of these results.

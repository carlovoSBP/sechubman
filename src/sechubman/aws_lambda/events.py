"""EventBridge-triggered Lambda handler.

Suppresses findings carried by a "Security Hub Findings - Imported" EventBridge event.

Returns `{"finding_state": "suppressed"}` or `{"finding_state": "skipped"}` and never raises, so
that a Step Function orchestrating this handler ahead of a ticketing integration can branch on
the result: `terraform-aws-mcaf-securityhub-findings-manager` relies on exactly this contract to
decide whether a finding still needs a Jira ticket after this handler has run.

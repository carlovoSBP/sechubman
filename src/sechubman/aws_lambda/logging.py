    without an explicit `log_event` argument, so whether the incoming event is logged (which can
    include full Security Hub finding payloads) is controlled entirely by the
    `POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT` environment variable (defaults to `false`); passing
    `log_event=True`/`False` explicitly at the call site would silently override that setting.

    """Load the rules document, from S3 if configured, otherwise from a local file.

    If both the `S3_BUCKET_NAME` and `S3_OBJECT_NAME` environment variables are set, the rules
    document is loaded from that S3 object. Otherwise, it is loaded from the local file at
    `RULES_PATH` (defaults to `rules.yaml`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    s3_client : BaseClient, optional
        The boto3 S3 client to use when loading rules from S3. Only used (and required) when
        `S3_BUCKET_NAME` and `S3_OBJECT_NAME` are both set. Accepting it as a parameter, rather
        than creating one internally, keeps this function free of AWS calls in unit tests.

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, Any]
        The parsed rules document, expected to contain a top-level `Rules` key and optionally a
        `ManagerConfig` key. See `sechubman.Manager.from_rules_document` for turning this into a
        ready-to-use `Manager`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If S3 loading is configured but no `s3_client` was provided.
